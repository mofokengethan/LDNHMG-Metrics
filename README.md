# Firebase Analytics

After you have configured the FirebaseApp instance, you can begin to log events with the logEvent() method. [Read more about events here.](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9322688#zippy=%2Crealtime-report%2Cdebugview-report)

You can use an event to measure when someone loads a page, clicks a link, or completes a purchase, or to measure system behavior, such as when an app crashes or an impression is served. For example: A news website might include events like "article_read" when a visitor finishes an article, "video_play" when they start a video, or "newsletter_signup" when they sign up for email updates. Measuring these events helps the website owner understand which content is most popular and how users engage with the site.
